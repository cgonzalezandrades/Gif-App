# Gif Web App

The Gif web app consumes data from Ghipy API generating 16 Gifs everytime the user presses one of the buttons. Althouh hte idea is to play with Pokemon Gifs, I made decision to not limit the application by only allowing users to type Pokemon names. 

In this app I used: 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* Bootstrap

Go ahead and visit my [Gif App](https://mighty-castle-87706.herokuapp.com/) and create random buttons by simply typing whatever you like. Have fun !

Please note that the key used for this application is a public key. otherwise, I would've used a .gitignore file for security purposes.
